# Hi, I'm Rutuja 👋

## 🚀 Business Analyst | Data Storyteller | AI/ML Enthusiast

Business Analyst at Accenture with 2+ years of hands-on experience driving impactful business solutions through data analysis, process optimization, and stakeholder management. I thrive on making sense of complex data—my favorite project to date: leading a Churn Prediction & Retention Strategy initiative. Recognized with the Pinnacle Award (High Performer, FY24) for delivering high-value results.

I’m proficient in business analysis, requirements documentation (BRD/FRD), UAT, and agile methodologies, with expertise in Power BI, Excel, Python, JIRA, Confluence, and Azure DevOps. My analytical mindset is complemented by strong communication, storytelling, and impact assessment skills—helping stakeholders make informed decisions that move the needle.

I’m a fast learner who’s passionate about applying AI/ML to real business challenges and always eager to grow. I believe great analysis isn’t just about numbers—it’s about uncovering the story behind them (and sometimes, interrogating the data until it confesses!).
